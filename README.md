# rest
Requirements:

Python 

Instructions:

git clone repository
change to repo directory

#python itty-new.py

You will be prompted to enter in a positive numerical value 

Press enter

The result will return the number you entered and below the fibonacci value


#Please note the original itty.py python micro-framework was simply copied then edited to import get_n.py which was written by myself.


For more complex application - plan would be to use Flask, Bottle, or in production Tornado to creat app for REST API using Python

Thank You,
